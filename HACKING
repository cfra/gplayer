This project will hopefully develop as I (or you :p) happen to run
into current limitations.

One design aspect I would like to keep though, is that it does not
depend on a specific environment. Ideally, it will be usable usin
either directfb output, xvimagesink or anything else which may come
up.
I ackowledge that some things might not be solvable using only
generic/GStreamer interfaces. Using X/GTK/Whatever interfaces is
fine with me, as long as it does not break other environments.

There many things which might be done to improve this player, a few
that come to my mind right now are:

    - test if audio only works
    - implement full screen support on X
    - handle keyboard layouts in a sane way (i.e: find a way to
      make # change the audio track and have it behave as expected
      on different keyboard layouts)
    - turn off screensaver on X
    - some people might find fullscreen mode interesting
      (for me, might window manager solves this sufficiently well)
    - add -ao as option
    - add -vf and -af as options - these could imho accept gstreamer
      pipeline descriptions
    - draw some kind of u.i. - if one could mix that into the stream
      to the imagesink, this would work on all thinkable environments
      out of the box, imho
